                        making, listening or playing it. I love reading both fiction and non-fiction as well almost any

                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>When I was in highschool I realized I wanted to pursue a career in programming. My initial
                        interest came with Excel and creating databases, something about figuring out the logic behind
                        the calculations just drew me in. I didn't know exactly what it was or what field it was
                        considered until I was introduced to Java. I immeaditaly took a great interest in figuring out
                        how to put code together in order to display specific processes on the command prompt. While
                        others in my class found it boring and useless, I knew that it was just the beginning and there
                        had to be a bigger purpose. So I decided to go to college to study programming. I went into a
                        degree program that focused on creating business systems. Where I learned the basics of C++,
                        Javascript, Servlets and Applets. Due to many reasons I couldn't finish my studies and had to
                        leave school. It's been a few years since then, but I knew one day I'd return back to studying
                        programming, since I felt I had a knack for it and enjoyed doing it so much.
                    </p>

                    <p>Being in college I worked on a lot of projects with others. Having the point of view of other
                        people in the mix, not to mention ones who are as interested and excited about coding and
                        developing like myself was really inspiring to create and push the limits of my skills to become
                        even better. </p>
                    <p>I'm a big goof in spite of seeming like a very serious person. I joke around alot because I'm
                        fully aware of the problems and issues we face in our World. It's this conscious understanding
                        that drives me not to take everything so serious and to just take everyday situations light
                        heartedly. It's all a coping mechanism because it can all really bring you down when you focus
                        on the woes and worries of the world, without actually ignoring them, I make it my duty to
                        uplift myself and others through jokes and witty sarcasm.</p>
